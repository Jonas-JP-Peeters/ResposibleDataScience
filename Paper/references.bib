    abstract = "{After decades of research and dozens of failed trials, the mainstay of the treatment of sepsis remains early administration of antibiotics and intravenous fluid resuscitation. The importance of early antibiotics in severe bacterial infection is biologically plausible and supported by numerous studies demonstrating a strong association with sepsis mortality. On the other hand, the evidence supporting the association of early intravenous fluid resuscitation with mortality in patients with sepsis is much more equivocal. Elucidating the precise role of intravenous fluids is critical in light of the high burden of sepsis as well as recent policy initiatives, such as the Centers for Medicare \\&amp; Medicaid Services’ Early Management Bundle, Severe Sepsis/Septic Shock (SEP-1) measure, that mandate early aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation.}",
